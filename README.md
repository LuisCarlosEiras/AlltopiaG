# Alltopia, the game

### Alltopia, the game,  uses Google Gemini-pro to analyze a utopian society based on selected characteristics and compare it with real-world country indices.

In this project, Google Gemini-pro is used for two main purposes: textual analysis and content generation.

#### 1. Textual Analysis:
Google Gemini-pro performs a detailed analysis of the utopian society created by the user. After the user adjusts the values of characteristics for an ideal society, such as "Social Equality" and "Sustainability," a prompt is generated to request a textual analysis. Google Gemini-pro processes this prompt and generates a text describing the utopian society based on the provided values. This analysis includes subtitles and multiple paragraphs, offering a detailed view of the idealized society.

#### 2. Comparison with Real-World Indices:
Google Gemini-pro compares the utopian society with the Human Development Index (HDI) of the best countries. A prompt is generated with the utopia's characteristics and the indices of countries like Norway, Switzerland, and Germany. Google Gemini-pro uses this information to generate a comparative text, putting the user's utopia into perspective with the best-performing countries. This text is divided into paragraphs, providing a clear comparison.

#### 3. Integration with DALL-E 3:
The project also integrates OpenAI's DALL-E 3 model for image generation. Based on the text generated by Gemini-pro, an image prompt is created and sent to DALL-E 3, which generates a visual representation of the idealized society. This image is displayed alongside the textual analysis, offering a comprehensive view of the utopia.
